# Fixing Vercel SPA Routing Issues

When deploying a React Single Page Application (SPA) with React Router to Vercel, you might encounter 404 errors when directly accessing routes like `/about` or refreshing on those pages. This is because Vercel's server doesn't know to serve the `index.html` file for these routes.

## Solution Applied

We've implemented the following fixes:

1. **Created a `vercel.json` file** with proper rewrites and routes:
   ```json
   {
     "rewrites": [{ "source": "/(.*)", "destination": "/index.html" }],
     "routes": [
       // Explicit routes for our application
       { "src": "/", "dest": "/index.html" },
       { "src": "/about", "dest": "/index.html" },
       // ... other routes
       { "src": "/(.*)", "dest": "/index.html" }
     ]
   }
   ```

2. **Added a `_redirects` file** in the `public` directory:
   ```
   /* /index.html 200
